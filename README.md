# dotfiles

A (hopefully) ever-growing collection of dotfiles I use.

### Requires

* git
* curl

### Install

First, be sure to setup ssh keys for github so you can actually pull this repo.

`curl -Lks https://git.io/fhQdn | /bin/bash`

Or, if you're not a fan of short URLs:

`curl -Lks https://gist.githubusercontent.com/minchingtonak/2cadbda35ec4b0bca4232da25eb9bf15/raw | /bin/bash`
